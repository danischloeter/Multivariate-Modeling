# Using the ‚Äúnumpy‚Äù and ‚Äúpandas‚Äù library in Python program perform the followings steps
# 1- Load the ‚Äútute1.csv‚Äù dataset.
#

# 2- Write a python program that calculate the correlation coefficient between Sales and AdBuget
# and display the following message on the console.
# ‚ÄúCorrelation Coefficient between Sales and AdBugdet is ________‚Äù
